# 3SUM
Objective-c implementation of 3SUM algorithm (+ 2SUM variant)

3SUM: Given an array of integers, determine if it contains three elements that sum to zero (or to a non-zero value).
2SUM: Given an array of integers, determine if it contains two elements that sum to zero (or to a non-zero value).

Includes solutions for bruteforce and reduced complexity approaches.
